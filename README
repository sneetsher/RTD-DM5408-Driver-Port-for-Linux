RTD DM5408 Driver Port for Linux

* Description:

A Linux driver for RTD DM5408 / DM408 ISA acquisition card. A DKMS module and
a dynamic library written from scratch but trying to keep same functions
structure of its official Windows 98 driver.


* Note:

This is my first real project using C. I just want to learn writing Linux
drivers for simple electronic hardwares. I use Ubuntu 10.04 i368 for development.

Well, I have tested both digital ports for input, :) Cool it works.
(Testing machine: Celeron 1.2GHz/256MB/Debian 6.0.2.1/i368/CLI)


* Authors:

see AUTHORS file.


* Build Dependencies:

gcc
make
linux-headers (for module)
dkms (recommended, for module)
libncurses (for demo)


* Installation:

# DKMS kernel module
# minimum needed ioctrl functions to read/write registers
# no need for make because DKMS will do.

cd src/mod
make install

# In case, DKMS is not possible (Some distributions does not have DKMS yet)
# dm5408_load_no-dkms.sh & dm5408_unload_no-dkms.sh are used to test module without installation;
# You can use them to modify dm5408.sh which is the init.d script that use DKMS.
# Keep in mind that the module is built only for current kernel,
# rebuild is needed after any kernel update.

cd src/mod
make
cp dm5408.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/updates/

# Shared library
# contains user space control functions

cd ../lib
make
make install

# Demo program

cd ../bin
make
make install
